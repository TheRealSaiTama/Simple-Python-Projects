# Simple Python Projects

This repository contains three very basic Python projects: a simple calculator, a dice rolling game, and a number prediction game. These projects are designed for beginners to practice their Python programming skills and explore different concepts.

## Projects

### 1. Simple Calculator

The simple calculator project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and the desired operation, and then displays the result.

### 2. Dice Rolling Game

The dice rolling game simulates rolling a pair of dice. The user can roll the dice and get random values between 1 and 6 for each die. It's a fun project to play with randomness and practice working with random number generation in Python.

### 3. Number Prediction Game

In the number prediction game, the program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess the number. The program provides hints such as "Too high" or "Too low" based on the user's guess until they guess the correct number.

## Getting Started

To run these projects on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-python-projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd simple-python-projects
   ```

3. Choose a project (e.g., calculator) and run the corresponding Python file:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

   Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
